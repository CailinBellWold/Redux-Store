## Core Objectives Met

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state...

1. When a user reviews the appâ€™s store, they find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.
2. When a user reviews the way the React front end accesses the store, they find that the app uses a Redux provider.
3. When a user reviews the way the app determines changes to its global state, then they find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.
4. When a user reviews the way the app extracts state data from the store, then they find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
5. When a user reviews the way the app dispatches actions, then they find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
